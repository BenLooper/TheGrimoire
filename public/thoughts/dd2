#### The Changing
I think I always thought that doing things in real life was too complicated, that everyone made things over-complicated for no reason. That this was a fact of nature, and there was little to be gained from engaging with most systems in real life. 
DD2 is a game of microsystems - they're not all fun, but they're _just_ good enough to be functional once you learn them. On top of that, you often have to manage multiple systems at once - slack a little bit, and you may find yourself in a bad situation, or worse yet losing  hours of progress. 
Layered on top of this simple management simulator is a stunningly beautiful world in which you frequently engage in deadly, satisfying combat, which is simple to learn yet difficult to master. Many of it's sequences are emergent, meaning every situation is a little bit different. This requires the player to also maintain a level of situational awareness and to accumulate game knowledge, to know how certain situations normally pan out, to identify and focus on an enemy's weaknesses.

If all of that sounds like a lot to manage, _you would not be wrong, it definitely is_. 

But this is where the direction of the game really shines. The game itself is really not that difficult, you could probably focus on one (of the many) vocations(classes) and clear the game relatively easily.

But playing _well_ is not easy. Playing _well_ requires practice, patience, and experimentation. It requires you to be prepared and situationally aware, and it requires you to accumulate and retain game knowledge.

The game doesn't really care if you play well, but is clearly meant to be played that way. And when it clicked for me, my god did it click.

It demanded I put equal thought into many small, seemingly insignificant things as I would the important things in a game - like the combat or decisions in the story. In fact, I probably spent more time making decisions about mundane things - like inventory management, or charting my path from one location to another - than I did making decisions in actual story beats.

So with all of the learning, all of this careful preparation, all of this time spent _immersing_ myself in these systems - reading every tutorial entry the game gives you _thoroughly_ (you would be shocked how carefully they word some things as to not give too much away), designing skillsets and game plans for different scenarios and enemies, practicing move sequences...I began to feel confident. 

At first, it was only confidence in my ability to play the game _well_. After learning so much about it, I started to understand the game more intuitively. Many times early on, I struggled to understand _what I was even supposed to be doing_. The quest markers are not entirely helpful, and reading the quest journal usually won't un-stick you. What worked for me almost without exception was to be engaged in the moment-to-moment of a quest, then combine the subtle hints that the game gives the player with what I saw and heard.

This game WANTS you to be engaged.

Learning it was not easy, and there were definitely nights that I just gave up playing it. Now for the really bizarre part - _I kind of think the game expected that_.

Without fault, I would come back and almost instantly resolve the issue I had the night before, then it was right back into the fun.

This loop, this casual but enjoyable process of learning and refining, is at the core of Dragon's Dogma 2's message for the player.

In the universe of DD2, they call it "Will", a power only the chosen of the world can weild. They never explicitly define what "Will" is, but I believe that it is the player's own will - to shape the world for the better (in the words of my pawn, as she sacrificed herself for me to fulfill my destiny).

Yes, my pawn said those words in the beautiful finale of this game, and that was when it all came crashing down onto me - I COULD do anything that I set my mind to. I FOUGHT to get where I was, I LEARNED everything that got me there. It wasn't easy, but I persisted, and here were the developers of the game saying directly to me - you can change the world for the better, you can do anything that you set your mind to.

I don't know about changing the entire world, but it certainly changed my world.

At first it was just the game, but since beating DD2 I have found that many things that used to be difficult in my life are a little easier. I trust more in the process, the journey - or rather, I trust myself to learn and enjoy the journey, to stay engaged and make the most out of it.

I feel more confident that if I am honest and patient with myself, I can follow any path that I set for myself and *enjoy it*.

### Feelings ;-;
The security that gives someone like me is really difficult to put into words.
When I go buy beer at the grocery store, I seriously can take up to 20 minutes to decide what I want.
I can talk myself out of almost anything, I can go to a restaurant that I love and order something that isn't close to what I want.
To not only be told, but to be _shown_ firsthand that my own will is something to be relished and enjoyed, not obsessed over and optimized, has been very transformative for me.
I feel secure knowing that even if I choose a wrong path, it's a lesson learned. Simply travelling the path is enough.
Sometimes life feels like a long process of untangling the things that I didn't realize I had been telling myself the entire time.

### The lesson in practice
Well, it turns out that enjoying the process of continuous learning and refinement applies to a lot of shit. Like, pretty much everything. Most importantly for me, it's helped reduce the noise in my life so that I can hear my own voice a little clearer. I'm more confident in pursuing things that interest me, and I'm more honest with myself about my own interest in things. 

Beyond even just my interests, I'm more confident in my ability to put my head down and learn what I need to in order to succeed, which is of course applicable in many fields, but especially in software where that's the entire job.
