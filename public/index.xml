      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;working-out-of-the-terminal-is-kinda-cool-guys&#34;&gt;Working out of the terminal is kinda cool guys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never thought I would be that guy, but here we are - I now have an embarrasing desire to use my computer as much as I can from the terminal.
I don&amp;rsquo;t really know exactly where it came from or why, all I can say is that it satisfies a desire in me to have control over my experience.
Since learning Neovim and adopting it as my primary editor, I had a realization that all of the applications that I&amp;rsquo;ve been using - Chrome, Spotify, VSCode - they&amp;rsquo;re all fancy wrappers for rudimentary tasks.&lt;br&gt;
Neovim showed me that something simpler, something totally free and transparent that I can make myself, could be just as good (if not better) than those apps.
This kind of software feels like a gateway to learning how things &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; work - you can look at the code yourself to understand what&amp;rsquo;s happening.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;welcome&#34;&gt;Welcome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m Ben, thanks for stopping by :^)
I&amp;rsquo;m a husband, a father to three cats, and I&amp;rsquo;m interested in&amp;hellip;a lot of things. Maybe too many things?
Either way, I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing about those things mostly, and I hope to also try my hand at some multi-media fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you might be wondering what I meant by &amp;ldquo;multi-media fun&amp;rdquo; a second ago - Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m the real Ben, the one that thinks
a little less about how I present myself and just sort of&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
