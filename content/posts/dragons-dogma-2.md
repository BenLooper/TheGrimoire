## Re-discovering Confidence with Dragon's Dogma 2

_Will is power - power to shape the world for the better._

---------------------------------------------------------------
#### Inadequacy
I want to do something, be something, accomplish something, but for it never happens.
I go about my days, sometimes life feels like it's blowing past me, and at the end of most days I feel disatisfied with myself.
It's usually not a very intense feeling, like a dull ache in the back of my mind, like I forgot to do something, like I should be doing more.
And somehow this feeling never goes away. I can distract myself from it, I can address it directly by being productive...

...but at the end of the day I'm still just me, and I wish I was someone better.

That is how I have felt for most of my life. Whether by my ego or by my best intentions, I feel like I've been clambering to "become" my entire life.
Become smarter, happier, richer, fitter, someone better than who I am. 
I don't _want_ to feel this way, but it's almost like I can't make myself feel differently, no matter what I do for myself to try to feel differently.

Well, uh, **cough**, I recently played this video game that helped me tackle this lifelong feeling of inadequacy.

#### Dragon's Dogma 2
Dragon's Dogma 2 takes place in a beautiful medieval fantasy setting, in which you (the player) has their heart stolen (as in carefully plucked from the chest) by a massive, old-english speaking dragon that _challenges_ you to defeat it, and reclaim your heart.

_Go, Arisen. And learn aught you can of this world you must protect._
- some ghost guy that only you can see at the beginning of the game

It is a lush, highly detailed, massive open world in which anyone and anything can die and it takes at least an hour to get from place to place without a magic rock or a cart pulled by actual oxen.


---------------------------------------------------------------
#### An Opinionated Game Experience
This world has it's own set of rules that aren't explicitly explained to you. There is not much hand-holding, only a tutorial logbook that you gradually fill out as you discover mechanics, and even that seems deliberately loosely worded (more on this later).

Fortunately, not all satisfaction is delayed in this world.
The physics and the combat of the world are fun from the jump - you tackle goblins and hold them down while your companions (you travel with 3 "pawns" who are like your adventure buddies) stab them, cast massively destructive spells, throw enemies around...it's a lot of fun.

The combat sort of functions as the fun connective tissue for the gameplay as a whole, and the vocation system (choosing and leveling up classes in other games) for both yourself and your "main pawn" (your best buddy that's with you all the time) and choosing the other two pawns for your party gives the player the ability to creatively approach any combat situation. 

So there's quite a bit of meat on the bone with that, and it's deep and varied enough to keep the player engaged from the start.

...which is a good thing, because DD2 is _very_ opinionated about how the game should be played, and without the combat it would be a tough pill to swallow. 

The two major pain points for me at the beginning that DD2 seemed unwilling to compromise on were navigating the map and the save system.

The map is highly detailed and dense, and when I first started I relied heavily on the mini-map the game gives you in the corner to understand where I was and where I was going.
