## Welcome
I'm Ben, thanks for stopping by :^)
I'm a husband, a father to three cats, and I'm interested in...a lot of things. Maybe too many things?
Either way, I'll be writing about those things mostly, and I hope to also try my hand at some multi-media fun.

Now you might be wondering what I meant by "multi-media fun" a second ago - Hi, I'm the real Ben, the one that thinks 
a little less about how I present myself and just sort of...

Does stuff.

Random, weird stuff.

For no reason other than to do it.

Can you even imagine doing that? Can you imagine just doing stuff, and not completely over-analyzing it beforehand?

I genuinely cannot, so we're going to do this together and we'll see what happens.

Ain't that right fake Ben? *offers handshake*



It's me, I'm fake Ben. As in I am both real Ben and fake Ben, fake Ben is made up, that was a joke.

I mean he's actually not (fake that is), I really did intend to write that as my first post but figured this might be more fun.

And also - I really don't know what I meant by "multi-media fun" or why I chose those that weird combination of words, but it's
the closest description I could give for the kind of stuff I want to do / make.

Alright goodnight ya'll, it's going to be a wild ride.
